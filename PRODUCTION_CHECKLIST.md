## üìã Pre-Production Tasks

### 1. Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.production` from template

    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
  ```
- [ ] Generate API credentials (Access Key ID & Secret)

- [ ] Optional: Configure custom domain for R2
- [ ] Set up lifecycle rules (optional, for cleanup)

### 5. Security Hardening
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS on all endpoints
- [ ] Configure rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
- [ ] Set up WAF rules (if available)
- [ ] Review and restrict CORS origins
- [ ] Enable security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Set up secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
- [ ] Disable Swagger docs in production (`ENABLE_SWAGGER_DOCS=false`)
- [ ] Configure file upload limits (50MB max)

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up Sentry for error tracking
  ```bash
  pip install sentry-sdk[fastapi]
  # Add SENTRY_DSN to .env.production
  ```
- [ ] Configure Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (ELK, CloudWatch, Datadog)
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Set up alerting rules
  - Database connection failures
  - High error rates (>1%)
  - High response times (>2s)
  - Disk space warnings (<20% free)
  - Memory usage warnings (>80%)

### 7. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add database indexes
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_audiobooks_status ON audiobooks(status);
  CREATE INDEX idx_audiobooks_created_at ON audiobooks(created_at DESC);
  ```
- [ ] Configure Redis caching
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Optimize worker count based on server specs
  - Recommended: `(CPU cores * 2) + 1`
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Enable gzip compression in Nginx

### 8. Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Set up automated database backups
  ```bash
  # Cron job for daily backups at 2 AM
  0 2 * * * /opt/audiobooker/scripts/backup-db.sh
  ```
- [ ] Configure R2 bucket replication (optional)
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedure
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Set up off-site backup storage (S3, GCS)

### 9. Testing
- [ ] Run unit tests
  ```bash
  cd backend
  pytest tests/
  ```
- [ ] Test health endpoint
  ```bash
  curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health
  ```
- [ ] Test file upload flow
- [ ] Test presigned URL generation
- [ ] Test file deletion
- [ ] Load testing with realistic traffic
  ```bash
  # Using Apache Bench
  ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://api.yourdomain.com/health
  ```
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid inputs)
- [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting

### 10. Deployment
- [ ] Build Docker image
  ```bash
  cd backend
  docker build -t audiobooker-api:v1.0.0 .
  ```
- [ ] Push to container registry
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests post-deployment
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Verify all endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Test complete user flow

## üîç Validation Checklist

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /health` - Returns 200 OK
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/upload/` - Accepts PDF, returns audiobook ID
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/audiobooks/` - Returns list of audiobooks
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/audiobooks/{id}` - Returns audiobook details
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/audiobooks/{id}/download` - Returns presigned URL
- [ ] `DELETE /api/v1/audiobooks/{id}` - Deletes audiobook and files
- [ ] `GET /docs` - Disabled in production (404)

### Storage (R2)
- [ ] Files upload successfully
- [ ] Files organized in correct structure: `{book_id}/{type}/{filename}`
- [ ] Presigned URLs work and expire correctly (1 hour)
- [ ] Files delete successfully from R2
